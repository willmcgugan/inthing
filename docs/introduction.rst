Introduction
============

Inthing is a Python module to send realtime events `<https://inthing.io>`_.

Streams
-------

An Inthing *stream* is a sequence of events, much like a social media timeline. Unlike social media, Inthing was intended more for machines to post to rather than people (although the latter is certainly possible).

How a stream is used and what kind of events are posted to it is entirely up to the developer. It can be used for something as sophisticated as a motion activated camera, or as simple as a one-liner to send a text notification.
