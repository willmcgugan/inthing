Introduction
============

Inthing is a Python module for `<https://inthing.io>`_.

Inthing users can create *streams* which are much like a social media timeline, and post *events* containing anything from rich-media to simple text. The streams are *realtime*, in that a new event will appear virtually instantaneously and without a page refresh.

How a stream is used and what kind of events are posted to it is entirely up to the developer. It can be used for something as sophisticated as a motion activated camera, or as simple as a one-liner to send a text notification.
